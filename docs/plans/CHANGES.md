# Plan / Checklist Change Log

Purpose:
- Record approved changes to docs/plans/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and
  docs/plans/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md during implementation.
- docs/context/MANUAL.md remains the source of truth for domain semantics.

Process rule (for agents):
- If you believe a change is needed, STOP and ask the human first.
- After the human approves and the change is applied, append an entry here.
- Keep entries small, factual, and link to affected milestones/files.
